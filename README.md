*** Two or more light sources (directional, point, area) that are NOT ambient. e.g.,
not counting the ambient light, you must have at least two light sources
A separate attached image of this is also located in this submission folder named
LightsSetup.png if you wish to view the full image. Basically the lights I added are all the
available lights in blender, and those are point lights, spot lights, sun light, and plane
lights.


*** Realistic shadowing -- multiple shadows for each object. For example, a
building with three light sources would show three shadows : The final image is
also located in this submission named FINAL-IMAGE.png if you wish to view full screen.
The final image shows realistic shadowing.


*** Reflections -- the light surfaces must reflect light and the other objects : Reflections
are also shown as light surfaces reflect light and the other objects


*** Transparency -- Some of the surfaces must be transparent, and reflect and refract
light : As seen in the final image, the first transparent cone which is the monkey hat, we
can clearly see the part of the monkey head still so it shows the coneâ€™s transparency.
Also the water is transparent and it reflects the objects and shows their shadows as
well.


*** Colors -- multiple colors that are shown in the shadows, and in the reflections and
transmitted light : As shown in the objects there are multiple colors that are displayed
that show their shadows and reflections as well.
*** At least FIVE 3D Geometric shapes -- Must have at least FIVE objects in the
scene : The five 3D geometric shapes are shown in the final image and they all have
different colors.


*** You must comment on TWO other colleagues with at least ONE paragraph per
comment to get credit for this final project. : NO DISCUSSION BOARD POSTED
